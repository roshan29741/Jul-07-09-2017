Create a class 'MyCollectionUtil' as shown below.
class MyCollectionUtil {
	def lst = [1,3,14,66,79,134,23,89,11]

	def compute(block){
		//YOUR CODE GOES HERE		
	}
}

Initialize the class with a list of numbers 1,3,14,66,79,134,23,89,11.
Implement the compute method in the class to use  closures that can perform the following on the list of numbers.

1) Print all even numbers
2) Print all numbers greater than any number "x"
3) Print the maximum of all the numbers

You can create MyCollectionUtilUser class where you call the compute method.
